## Introduction
The end of Apple's fall 2021 conference brought the MageSafe magnetic animation to the audience and the iPhone. When your iPhone 12/13 is connected to the MageSafe charger, there will be an animation showing that the iPhone is charging, and this is the original intention of my development of this software.

This device is written specifically for the MacBook Air with M1 chip, this is because my girlfriend and I are using a couple's MacBook AirüëÄ, another reason is that there is no charging animation for other devices at hand, or no suitable can be used as an animation displayed when charging other models of Mac. In short, on the one hand because I wanted a charging animation myself, and on the other because I wanted to write a feature like this (exclusively) for my girlfriend üòÇ.

## How to use
This software is currently in the first version stage, which means that the software has only some simple functions, and I will consider developing more functions in the future.

When your Mac is connected to the charger, a pop-up window similar to AirPods on the iPhone will appear, you can refer to the picture above.
The content displayed on the pop-up window is as follows:
- Your device's name
- The remaining battery power of the device
- When your device is connected to the charger, it will display the time when the device is fully charged
- When your device is not connected to a charger, it will display the remaining usage time of the device

### Error handling and Button
When using this software, if the program is not displayed for a long time, the charging interface cannot be popped up or the battery percentage cannot be updated after recharging(very small probability). For this situation, I designed a program loading button. 

In order not to spoil the overall aesthetics of the interface, I put the functions of exiting the software and reloading the program both on the button in the upper right corner, which uses your gestures to identify what needs to be done:
- Tap this button to reload the program
- Long press this button to quit app

## Installation
You can always download the latest version [here](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/Mac-Charge-Monitor/releases). Hope you guys will enjoy it‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Extension or develop more functions
If you have better ideas or animations that can be used as other Macs, welcome to participate in the development or you can download the source code and develop it yourself.
